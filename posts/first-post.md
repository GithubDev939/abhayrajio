Hello, all!

This is my first blog post and I'm not actually sure what kind of content I want to put here. It WILL be centered around my academic stuff, though.

I'm thinking that maybe I should post about one or more of these (maybe even all of them):
 - My USACO Journey
 - Algorithms and Data Structures
 - AMC 10/12 Contest Preparation
 - Homework for School
 - Extracurricular Activities

Whatever I decide to post on, I'll make sure to keep this blog updated.
